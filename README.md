# About it
The system offers the possibility to list user-owned restaurants or to view them as a customer. The owner lists his restaurant after going through a verification through the Stripe platform, enters his details and his bank account to withdraw his winnings. It publishes useful information about the restaurant such as contact details, images, logo, QR code-based digital menus and online reservations with secure payment. The customer can view the restaurants in an interactive and easy-to-use page, contact the restaurant, reserve a seat and so on.
